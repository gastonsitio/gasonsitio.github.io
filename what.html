		<h1>What is this</h1>
		<p>This place you are browsing right now is my little site, my place in the vast seas of the Internet. A small wish from childhood, fed by the context of my generation, when we had a starting social internet where browsing was very disperse, without so many centralities who manipulating the experience (such as social networks).
		<p>The Internet can be as enigmatic and unknown as the oceans or outer space. Discovering and exploring its depths feels like a fantasy coming true. Getting to places I never could have imagined, meeting creative beings who have their own website and make me spend time having fun and getting to know new perspectives that exist in this world.
		<p>That said, this site tries to break away from the current navigation structures looking for the mental state that precedes it, where the Internet did not generate anxiety or alter the perception of time and contemplation in reading. Not everything is twitter, the internet can be different.
		<p>Feel free to navigate this site as your intuition tells you. I have loose fingers and a loose tongue, which makes me type a lot. You'll find a lot of unexpected text stuffed in there. Pay attention and have a good trip.
		<p>I sincerely appreciate any communication you want to have with me. Comments, greetings, discussions, insults, letters, drawings. Any reaction is welcome.
